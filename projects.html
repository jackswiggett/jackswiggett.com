  <h2>A few projects that I've worked on over the last several years</h2>

  <div class="project">
    <h3>
      BetterNote
      <span class="project-links">
        <a href="https://github.com/jackswiggett/BetterNote" target="_blank">GitHub</a> |

    </h3>
    <h4>A web app to evaluate alternative music notation systems</h4>
    <h5><strong>Technologies:</strong> JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, Node.js, MongoDB</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Built an application to test users' ability to read music notation and identify one-, two-, and three-note chords on a virtual piano keyboard</li>
      <li>Supports testing traditional western notation and Klavarskribo; modularized to allow for supporting additional notation systems in the future</li>
      <li>Records accuracy and speed as well as metadata for each test, which is stored in a searchable/filterable results database for comparison and analysis</li>
      <li>I also prepared a test plan and documents describing each notation system, ran tests of each system with ten participants, and wrote a research paper analyzing my results</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>
      Agricopter
      <span class="project-links">
        <a href="https://github.com/jkamalu/agricopter" target="_blank">GitHub</a>
      </span>
    </h3>
    <h4>An algorithm and web platform to facilitate automated mission planning for agricultural drones</h4>
    <h5><strong>Technologies:</strong> Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Node.js, MongoDB</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Worked on a team of two under the supervision of a researcher at ISEP in Paris</li>
      <li>The linked GitHub repo implements a coverage path planning algorithm which efficiently finds a path for an autonomous drone to traverse all areas of a polygonal field defined by GPS coordinates, while avoiding any obstacles within the field</li>
      <li>We also built a web platform that interfaced with our algorithm, allowing users to define field coordinates using Google Maps, generate a coverage path, and send commands to a drone over a local network</li>
      <li>Systems like this one could be used to help drones more efficiently monitor crop health and administer fertilizer or pesticides</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>
      Functional Web Apps
      <span class="project-links">

    </h3>
    <h4>A bare-bones web app implemented in Elm and Reason, along with a comparison of the two languages</h4>
    <h5><strong>Technologies:</strong> Elm, Reason, ReasonReact, HTML, CSS</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Implemented the same basic web application in two functional languages that compile to JavaScript, Elm and Reason, with the exact same UI and functionality in each implementation</li>
      <li>Took notes throughout the development process, and compiled a paper describing the characteristics, advantages, and disadvantages of each language</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

    </h3>
    <h4>A native iOS app prototype to help people who have recently moved to a new country</h4>
    <h5><strong>Technologies:</strong> Swift, iOS SDK, Xcode</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Built a high fidelity prototype for an app that gives newcomers to a country the chance to explore their new surroundings, make new friends, and push themselves out of their comfort zone</li>
      <li>As a team of three, we went through a rigorous, iterative process of needfinding, prototyping, and user testing/evaluation; I wrote 100% of the code for the final app prototype</li>
      <li>I also starred in our concept video &#9786 (link above)</li>
    </ul>

  <div class="project">
    <h3>
      Canoe
      <span class="project-links">

    </h3>
    <h4>A React Native app to facilitate spontaneous and inexpensive travel</h4>
    <h5><strong>Technologies:</strong> JavaScript, React Native, Node.js, Microsoft Azure</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Canoe automatically finds inexpensive, upcoming round-trip flights to destinations based on users' price and duration preferences, and recommends new destinations based on how they've rated previous travel experiences</li>
      <li>I built Canoe with a team of four in 36 hours for TreeHacks 2017, where we won the "Best Use of Amadeus API" award accompanied by a $2000 prize</li>
      <li>I wrote a large majority of the React Native application, which included a list and map of upcoming trips, a screen with details and a photo for each destination, a screen to configure trip preferences, and an interface to rate past trips</li>
    </ul>

      Limerick Land

    <h4>A web platform for creating and sharing collaborative, crowdsourced poetry</h4>
    <h5><strong>Technologies:</strong> JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React, Node.js, MongoDB</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>Limerick Land allows users to collaboratively write limericks, one line at a time, building off each other's ideas, with built-in rhyme and syllable validation</li>
      <li>Limericks grow in a branching structure, so that each line can have multiple possible continuations, and users can explore many different endings to the same limerick</li>
      <li>I built and deployed Limerick Land with a team of three, and we attracted over 150 unique users to the site</li>
    </ul>
